TO ASK


Need to figure out how to Query multiple tables in my route.get('/useractivity').
    - need to show activity name from Activities table for the route ('/useractivity')
    - look to Sequelize 1 to many Assoications for my Database. It will work magically if it's on my models. 
    - Still trying to figure out why my 1:m isn't working correctly.


Need to work on remote connection to heroku Databases with Postico


How to handle cannot get err property id of undefined if user session ends with server cut for a period of time? 
    - route /useractivity
    - I'm losing my user.id somewhere??
